# Shell settings
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emanuelen5/Shell-settings.svg?branch=Ubuntu)](https://travis-ci.org/emanuelen5/Shell-settings)

These are the shell settings that I use in my terminal. Copy anything that you like. I might even accept pull requests.

This branch is for shells running under Ubuntu (or other native Unix userspaces).
